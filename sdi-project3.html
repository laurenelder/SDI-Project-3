<article>
<p>This is a story about a war raging on the drag stip. The cars included are a 1993
 Ford Mustang, 1986 Chevy Camaro Z28, 2000 Acura Integra, and a 2010 Dodge Viper. If 
 you were not aware boost is a term used to describe forced induction, ie a turbo or 
 supercharger, and nitrous is an oxidizer allowing the engine to consume much more fuel. 
 The winner will be determined by the car with the lowest pounds per horsepower ratio.</p>
